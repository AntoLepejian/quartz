1. There exists no solution for a UNSW student to view their timetable in a
   manner that emphasizes the parts that are important to them on a daily basis,
   particularly the time to the next class and the classes for the day.
2. A UNSW student cannot easily find their way to their classes at the start of
   each teaching period â€” some rooms are hard to locate.
3. Many UNSW students do not know about the existence of the Personal Timetable
   service, so they manually enter the timetable into a calendar application,
   which is an error-prone and time-consuming process.
4. A student who wants to find the next bus from Central to UNSW, or vice versa,
   currently has to use a trip planner, which introduces a lot of friction.
   - Students often wait in line for more than half an hour because they don't
     know the time of the next bus.
   - Students are unaware of public buses that could, rarely, save them time.
5. It is too easy for a student to neglect to check the weather at UNSW, and as
   a result neglect to bring an umbrella on a rainy day.
